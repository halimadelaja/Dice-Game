# Dice-Game
This is an improvised Dice Game built using HTML, CSS and vanilla JS(mostly DOM). 
How it works: A random number between 1-6 is generated for each of the two players. A player wins when the number generated is higher than the other player's and we declare who's the winner. And there is a draw if same random number was generated for both players at the same time.
